## My process

### Built with


- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Modules
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

My first try with React. I was learning on the fly , wasnt the easiest way  , but it was effective for me. The css modules are messy , but i hated how Styled Components look with those template strings.

ill get better each step, next time. As long as we breathe , as they say... :)
